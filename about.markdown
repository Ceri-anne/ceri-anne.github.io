After working in Credit Risk management for 14 years I decided to change career and move into software development.

After teaching myself to code, attending Sky's Get into Tech programme and loads of hard work I got my first job as a junior developer in Nov 2016.

Now coding in Swift, developing iOS apps and loving it!

The aim of this blog is to share some knowledge and help me learn by explaining.
